<b>Part 1 - Basic Understanding of how the internet works</b><br>

<p>
The Web - World Wide Web<br>

Collection of HTML documents (Hyper Text Markup Language). Makeup of almost every webpage. <br>

Hyperlinks between pages create web<br>

Major pieces - Me + Computer + Browser...The Internet ... HTTP(main protocol of the web) connects servers to the internet. 
Servers are optimised for hosting files<br>

"The internet uses HTTP to communicate with you, your browser, and servers."<br>

HTML - HyperText Markup Language<br>

HTML = Text content (what you see), Markup (what content looks lile), References to other documents (videos, images), links to other pages<br>
</p>


<b>Part 2 - HTML</b><br>

<p>
HTML Markup - Tags<br>
NAME tag <NAME> CONTENTS </NAME><br>
Opening tag <>          closing tag has a / , just a slash in front of name<br>
it's an Element<br>

<br>



em - emphasis - italics em tag <br>

If you don't close tags, it applies it to everything after the opening tag.


HTML attributes...ATTR = the name of the attribute. can have multiple attributes



anchor = 'a' tag = for making links <br>

href="www.reddit.com"

img = images <br>
img src="url" alt="text" , it's a void tag, so it has no closing tag/content  alt text is required.Helps broken requests or blind people <br>

White Space , text on multiple lines. 'br' break, it's a void tag, so no closing tag needed. Can have multiple breaks. <br>

'p'= paragraph tag <br>


Why do we have 'p' and 'br' <br>

It's because the 'br' is inline, and the 'p' is block. image is inline also <br>

'br' just ends line <br>
'p' makes an invisible box, it can have height and width. will become more important later <br>

'span' = inline <br>

'div' = block <br>

span class ="foo">.... foo = css (styles) <br>


Inline = a , span, br, img, strong.  <br>
Block = p, div, form <br>
</p>
